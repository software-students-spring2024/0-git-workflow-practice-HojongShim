This is Nasdaq's recent [article](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/ev-trends-for-2024-what-to-expect-from-the-electric-vehicle-market) on its forecast on the electric vehicle market for 2024.

The Electric Vehicle (EV) market on Nasdaq is poised for significant growth in 2024. The sector is expected to generate $561.3 billion in revenue, with a project compound annual growth rate of 10% through 2028, reaching $906.7 billion in sales. 

Key trends include the continued growth of EV sales, which surpassed 1 million in September 2023, and the expectation that all-electric vehicles will account for over 10% of total vehicle sales in 2024. 

Declining prices, driven by technological advancements like Ideal Power's B-TRAN and improvements in battery technologies, are making EVs more affordable. Advances in solid-state EV batteries, with Toyota leading the way, promise increased energy density and range.

The adoption of Tesla's charging plug by other automakers is anticipated to expand charging infrastructure, while exploration of battery swapping technology continues.

These trends highlight the momentum and potential of the EV market in 2024, making it a crucial focus for investors seeking opportunities in this rapidly evolving industry.

### Stella Zhang:
It looks like EVs are the future, which makes sense, at least in car-centric societies. Battery swapping seems like a promising solution to the problem of charging.

### al6862:
Agree with Stella, it seems like EVs are the future! I wonder what future cars will run on beyond electric. Will this trend towards electric vehicles also affect public transportation?
